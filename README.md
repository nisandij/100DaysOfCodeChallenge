# 100DaysOfCodeChallenge
 #100DaysOfCode challenge for Machine Learning

I decided to take up the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter. Doing this mainly because I need the motivation to get started with my Final Year Project. Iâ€™m using Google Colab to try out the code and you can check this GitHub repository for updates.
